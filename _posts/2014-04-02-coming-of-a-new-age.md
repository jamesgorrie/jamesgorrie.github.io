After volunteering with AgeUK to run a tech-teaching session with the elderly community from the local King's Cross area, I was left with a lingering question: does this generation really need all this technology?

In searching for the answer, and hopefully the chance to be part of it, off I trotted to the Hack Weekend hosted by AgeUK. We would collectively be searching for any potential roles technology could play in enhancing the lives of our elder generations based off a three year research piece led by a group of organisations – hdti, Grandparents Plus, Years Ahead, SEHTA and Age UK – called COMODAL.

To start off we must acknowledge a definite need for and benefit in technology helping people with the challenges of dementia, social isolation and severe mobility issues, to name just a few. These new and intelligent gadgets can help raise their standards of living, which in turn increases their sense of independence. This leads to a longer, happier life, while also cutting the costs for governments in what is considered an already overstretched system.

This particularly vulnerable demographic should be considered as one of the highest priority when it comes to care. It is, however, incorrect to use age as the paramount factor in deciding the amount of care needed. By doing so we are at risk of exacerbating their vulnerability by stripping them of their independence. There are a great deal of healthy, energetic, and financially independent people, who want services simply to spice up their lives. Services which, if produced in a more accessible way (using language and design which is more familiar and understandable), could lead this generation to have more active and valuable social lives and maintain their independence for longer. This leads to a continuation of a better lifestyle, not only physically but – arguably more importantly – mentally.

Throughout the weekend we conversed with two particularly powerful characters, Robin and Ruth. Robin, 62, ran her own financial advice company. Most of her clients were around her age or older and she showed no signs of wanting to retire any time soon. She used technology throughout her day, as any businesswoman would. Keeping herself up to date with the financial industry, using email and Skype for business and personal communication. She used technology and the internet functionally, but saw little leisure value in it, bar the news and occasionally iPlayer. Robin had also previously cared for an elderly relative who had suffered dementia in her older age.

Ruth, who was 80, was an inspiration, amongst a myriad of other things. She was on just about every volunteer list possible, involved in local council meetings and generally getting more done than most the 20-30 somethings in the room. She was also incredibly active in advising her peers who were approaching her stage in life about matters such as downsizing and preparing for a completely different style of living.

There was a running theme: our older generations, through a series of fairly bottom-up based systems, are organically becoming the best carers for their peers. This seems to create a mutually beneficial feedback loop. The volunteer, whilst caring for someone’s needs, in turn learns first hand about situations that might arise for them in their coming years. And whilst may seem like an efficient self-sustaining ecosystem, there is something amiss with people who are entering their golden years looking after the elderly. Efficient as it is, there is more colour required when dealing with peoples lives.

At first I was sceptical of the data and information received prior, having been subject to trying to help the elderly with gadgets that had been needlessly sold to them. But, after talking to people whose lives we were meant to be improving, most of everyone who was involved over the weekend came to similar conclusions: We have a group of people who already know what they want, aren't afraid to ask for it, and when they do, no-one seems to think there is much value in creating something to cater for these requests.

A valuable service – one that would address a key, existing issue – was suggested by Ruth. She advises people on downsizing as she says it was an experience she would never want to even go near again.

"Why?", we asked? She had two estate agents to deal with. Removal companies to get quotes from. She had a requirements list as long as a good scroll as this was the last move she was going to do for the rest of her life ("A sea to swim in and a river to yacht in"). She had to know what to do with all her stuff, how could she keep her sentimental possessions and get a fair price for what she was willing to part with? To add to this she had health issues at the time. In her words,"The devil was in the piano". I'm still not 100% certain what she meant by that, but she was very clear that she would have been more than willing to pay for a good service provider to do all of this for her, especially someone who could have found a way to move her beloved piano to her new home and not have to leave it behind.

So, after having listened, the weekend came to an end, with Brightmove winning with the fabulous idea of retirees being able to share potentially lost skills and experience for cash post retirement.

So does this lively bunch need all this technology? I would say no, they are finding solutions to the challenges age brings amongst themselves, as is the versatility of human nature. However, we could mend the gap forming between the older and younger generations by creating more inclusive and accessible technological services. On top of that we could fill the holes that have not been created by age, but have been caused by a society which is moving inconsiderately and unnecessarily fast; where change has become the feature and not the means of how the feature is achieved.

One of my favourite sound-bites from the research, “You’re calling it telecare, which no-one really knows, people have got used to community alarm, and actually 90 odd percent of your activities are community alarm”. This is highlighting a predicament not only in the lives of the sirs and ma’ams of our society, but something more prominent across generations. We are worshipping the New (The Newphoria campaign for Norton?) simply for its newness instead of the value that it might bring.

It will be important that we fulfil this role responsibly, thoughtfully and cost effectively, being wary of the nature of markets to exploit. It was inspiring to work with many who seemed to think along similar lines, being led by companies such as AgeUK advocating a future of enhancing the enjoyment of life for one of the most valuable but overlooked parts of our society. One I hope we will never lose touch with, as we will all be there soon enough.
